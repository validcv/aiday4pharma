(Note: This expects you have created a fork of the validcv repo as mentioned in the reference document)

$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/validcv/aiday4pharma
(Note replace “validcv” with your specific username on github”

$ cd aiday4pharma/speech/

$ ./train-speech.sh srija-ieee
(Note 1: Replace srija-ieee with your username.)
(Note 2: Your dataset should be in a file with .txt extension)
(Note 3: Do NOT use the .txt extension in the train and infer commands)
(Note 4: You can train and experiment with all datasets available, but your task will be complete only if you have submitted your own dataset for the chatbot)

$ ./infer-speech.sh srija-ieee
(Note 1: Do NOT use the .txt extension in the train and infer commands)

This completes your basic introduction to AI implementation tools; viz.

Basics of Linux
Familiarization with frameworks – you have used TensorFlow
Familiarization with models – you have cloned and used the DeepQA project built on LSTM model for building your chatbot
Dealing with datasets – you have created a conversation dataset and trained the DeepQA model on that
You may also try other examples in Katacoda, but that is optional.
